# Terms of Service
Last Updated: February 15th, 2025

## 1. Introduction

Ribbon is a Discord bot designed to integrate and synchronize, wherever readable and accessible, Roblox features, digital assets, and other API functionalities. By using Ribbon, you agree to these Terms of Service. If you do not agree, you must discontinue use immediately.

## 2. Scope of Service

Ribbon provides various features, including but not limited to:

* Fetching and displaying publicly available Roblox data.  
* Synchronizing roles and permissions between Discord and Roblox.  
* Providing automated notifications related to Roblox assets and activities.  
* Facilitating API-based integrations with authorized third-party services.  
* Enhancing user experience with accessible Roblox-based utilities.

## 3. Acceptable Use

Users must adhere to all applicable laws, as well as Discord’s and Roblox’s Terms of Service. The following actions are strictly prohibited:

* Exploiting Ribbon for fraudulent, malicious, or illegal activities, including phishing, scamming, or distributing malware.  
* Attempting to manipulate, reverse-engineer, or bypass Ribbon’s security features.  
* Violating the terms of any platform Ribbon integrates with, including Discord and Roblox.

Violation of these terms may result in access restrictions or bans, and severe cases may be reported to relevant platform administrators or authorities.

## 4. Compliance with Discord and Roblox Policies

Ribbon operates in compliance with Discord’s and Roblox’s Terms of Service. If found in violation of these policies, Ribbon’s services may be restricted or terminated without prior notice.

## 5. Data Usage and Privacy

Ribbon may access and process publicly available data permitted by Discord’s and Roblox’s API policies, including but not limited to:

* **Roblox Public Data:** Usernames, display names, group affiliations, public game assets, and statistics such as place visits.  
* **Discord Public Data:** Server roles, permissions, and channel structures for synchronization purposes.

### How Data is Accessed and Used

* Data is retrieved **only when necessary** and is not stored beyond its operational requirement.  
* Ribbon does **not** collect or process private or sensitive information beyond what is publicly available or explicitly authorized by the user.  
* All data interactions comply with Discord’s and Roblox’s API guidelines to ensure security and compliance.

## 6. User Responsibility and Security

* Users are responsible for maintaining the security of their own Roblox and Discord accounts, including ensuring they are not compromised by bad actors.  
* If a user’s account is compromised due to negligence, it is their duty to act immediately by changing passwords, enabling two-factor authentication (2FA), and notifying relevant authorities.  
* Ribbon does **not** request or store passwords and will **never** ask users for login credentials.  
* Users should avoid sharing sensitive data with anyone claiming to represent Ribbon.  
* Any unauthorized activity should be reported immediately to Ribbon’s team for assistance in mitigating potential losses.

## 7. Disclaimers and Limitation of Liability

Ribbon is provided **"as is"** without any warranties, express or implied. We do not guarantee uninterrupted or error-free operation of the bot.

To the fullest extent permitted by law:

* We disclaim liability for any loss, damage, or disruption caused by the use or inability to use Ribbon.  
* We are not responsible for damages, whether direct, indirect, incidental, consequential, or otherwise arising from Ribbon’s use.  
* Users assume full responsibility for any risks associated with using Ribbon.

## 8. Potential Risks

While Ribbon is designed to be secure and reliable, users should be aware of potential risks, including:

* **Unintended Data Exposure:** While Ribbon only accesses publicly available data, users should take care not to share sensitive information.  
* **Service Downtime:** Ribbon depends on third-party APIs, which may experience downtime or modifications that impact availability.  
* **Third-Party Misuse:** Users should be cautious of impersonators or unauthorized modifications of Ribbon.  
* **Integration Issues:** Synchronization with Roblox or Discord may not always function as expected due to platform changes.  
* **Security Vulnerabilities:** No system is entirely secure; any suspected vulnerabilities should be reported immediately.

## 9. Amendments to Terms

We may update these Terms of Service periodically. Continued use of Ribbon after changes are made constitutes acceptance of the revised terms. Users will be notified of significant updates through the **HAKUMI Discord server** and the official Ribbon website.
