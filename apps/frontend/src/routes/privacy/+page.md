# Privacy Policy
Last Updated: February 15th, 2025

## 1. Introduction

This Privacy Policy explains how Ribbon collects, uses, stores, and protects user data while providing its services. By using Ribbon, you acknowledge and agree to the practices outlined in this policy. If you do not agree, please discontinue use immediately.

## 2. Data Collection

Ribbon only collects and processes data necessary to provide its services. The data falls into the following categories:

### 2.1 Public Data

Ribbon accesses publicly available data from Discord and Roblox, which is permitted by their respective API policies. This includes but is not limited to:

* **Roblox Public Data:** Usernames, display names, group affiliations, public game assets, and statistics such as place visits.  
* **Discord Public Data:** Server roles, permissions, and channel structures used for synchronization.

Public data is retrieved in real-time and is not stored beyond what is necessary for operational use.

### 2.2 User-Provided Private Data

Ribbon does not require users to provide private or sensitive information. However, certain commands or features may allow users to input data voluntarily. Examples include:

* Custom role assignments within a Discord server.  
* Manual entry of user preferences for specific features.  
* Other optional user-provided inputs for bot functionality.

This data is used strictly for the purpose it was provided and is not shared with third parties.

## 3. Legal Basis for Processing Data

Ribbon processes data based on the following legal grounds:

* **Legitimate Interest:** Data is processed to provide the services users expect from Ribbon, such as role synchronization, automated notifications, and improving bot performance.  
* **User Consent:** In cases where users voluntarily provide data, their consent is the basis for processing.  
* **Compliance with Legal Obligations:** Ribbon may retain certain data if required by law or regulatory requirements, such as responding to law enforcement requests, complying with tax or fraud investigations, or fulfilling legal reporting obligations. Example: If required by law enforcement due to an official investigation into malicious activities, Ribbon may be legally required to provide relevant data.

## 4. Purpose of Data Use

All collected data is used solely for the following purposes:

* To provide bot functionalities, including user role synchronization and notifications.  
* To maintain and improve Ribbon’s performance and security.  
* To ensure compliance with Discord’s and Roblox’s API policies.

Ribbon **does not** sell, share, or use collected data for advertising, tracking, or analytics purposes.

## 5. Data Storage and Security

Ribbon employs industry-standard security measures to protect data integrity and prevent unauthorized access. The storage and retention of data follow these principles:

* **Temporary Data:** Most user interactions and API-retrieved data are processed in real-time and not retained.  
* **Permanent Data:** If certain settings or configurations are saved for server use, they remain stored until modified or deleted by the user.  
* **Security Measures:** Encryption, access controls, and regular audits are in place to safeguard data.  
* **Breach Response:** In the event of a data breach, users will be notified as soon as possible, and appropriate security measures will be taken to mitigate risks.

## 6. User Rights

Users have the following rights regarding their data:

* **Access:** Users may request a copy of the data Ribbon has associated with them.  
* **Erasure:** Users can request the deletion of stored data related to their activity.  
* **Correction:** Users can request corrections to inaccurate or incomplete data.

Until an automated feature is available on the official website, users can exercise these rights by contacting the Ribbon team via the **HAKUMI Discord server** or emailing **help@hakumi.cafe**.

## 7. Third-Party Data Sharing

Ribbon **does not** share, sell, or distribute user data to third parties. Data is only accessed as necessary to provide the intended functionality and is not used for marketing, tracking, or analytics.

## 8. Policy Updates

This Privacy Policy is subject to change at any time. Users will be notified of updates via the **HAKUMI Discord server** and the official Ribbon website. Continued use of Ribbon after updates constitutes acceptance of the revised policy.
